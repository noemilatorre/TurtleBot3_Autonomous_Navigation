# 🚧 TurtleBot3 Lane Following & Traffic Light Recognition

This ROS package enables a **TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi** to autonomously navigate inside a lane, stop at traffic lights, and recognize traffic signs (like STOP).

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Follow a colored lane using a camera
- Detect and respond to **red, yellow, and green** traffic lights
- Recognize a **STOP** sign
- Combine camera and LiDAR data for robust behavior

## 📄 File Descriptions

### `turtlebot_control.cpp`
Main node that:
- Subscribes to camera 
- Controls robot movement based on lane and traffic light detection
- Manages state transitions (go, slow, stop)
- Publishes traffic status 

### `vision_processing.cpp`
Handles:
- Image segmentation to detect red, yellow, and green traffic lights
- Lane line segmentation
- STOP sign segmentation and recognition
- Hue, saturation, and brightness (HSV) filtering
- ROI analysis and contour-based classification
